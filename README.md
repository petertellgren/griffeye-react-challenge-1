# Griffeye React Challenge

## Instructions

Write a component that includes an input field and and a
submit button, below it, a list of images. At the start, the list
should be empty. When the user submits some string input-string, the
function should append the robot image corresponding to that string
to the current list of images. The source of the image is
‘https://robohash.org/input-string’.

<img src="https://robohash.org/hello?size=100x100" />

this service provides unique images for any text. For example, put
https://robohash.org/hello in your browser and you’ll see the image
above. Put any other string, and you’ll see a different image. When
a user clicks on a robot image, the image should be removed from the
list. Finally, if you are inclined to take on styling details,
center the input field and display the robot list in centered rows
that wrap to the next line after exceeding the page’s width. After
entering many robots, the page should look something like this:
